  "Sozopol is now one of Bulgaria's most popular resorts, with medieval churches and wide sandy beaches. But it is that embracing harbour that first brought travelling ancient Greeks to Sozopol more than 2,500 years ago. The town's modern name derives from the Greek for City of Salvation, but in the first millennium BC it was called Apollonia Pontica (Apollo of the Black Sea) after the great Greek Sun god Apollo. Apollonia Pontica grew into a bustling port city, complete with a substantial temple to Apollo, and a 13m-tall bronze image of the god. As far as ancient Greek statues go, this was second in size only to the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Famous throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Apollonia Pontica's giant statue featured on the city's coins and was eventually stolen by the Romans.",

  `Car company Volvo has abandoned its target to produce only fully electric cars by 2030, saying it now expects to be selling some hybrid vehicles by that date. The carmaker blamed changing market conditions for its decision to give up a target it had announced only three years ago. It comes as the industry faces a slowdown in demand in some major markets for electric vehicles EVs and uncertainty due to the imposition of trade tariffs on EVs made in China. Volvo, which has traditionally flaunted its environmental credentials, joins other major carmakers General Motors and Ford in rowing back on EV ambitions. Volvo now expects at least 90% of its output to be made up of both electric cars and plug-in hybrids by 2030. The Swedish company may also sell a small number of so-called mild hybrids, which are more conventional vehicles with limited electrical assistance.`,

  `On the road north-west from Glasgow through the hills of Argyll, civilisation peels away and the landscape becomes emptier of life and stories – but only to the untrained eye. As the road clears Loch Fyne, curving north out of the village of Lochgilphead, the great expanse of Kilmartin Glen comes into view. This was once the Scotland seen by the 6th- and 7th-Century kings of the ancient Gaelic kingdom Dál Riata, and the raised bogland greets the visitor with rumpled hills, fields settled by Blackface sheep and forests planted with deeply-rooted oak. But look closer – much closer still, as the road weaves north to harbour town Oban – and it quickly becomes clear that Kilmartin Glen is a place where history lurks in great abundance. For this is the setting of a prehistoric collection of henge monuments, burial cairns, standing stones, cist chambers, stone circles and the densest concentration of rock art sites anywhere in Britain, with more than 800 ancient relics at the last count. This multitude was built before the Romans and Greeks came along, before the first pyramids were built some 4,700 years ago and before Stonehenge, Britain's other great prehistoric monument. Interpretations of Kilmartin Glen by various archaeologists and antiquarians all agree it is one of Britain's greatest treasures.`,

  `The Waveney for me, as my local river, has always been a kind of escape route, the late naturalist and wild swimming enthusiast Roger Deakin once said in a BBC radio piece. It's a way into another world. The Waveney is my local river, too. And as this year marks 25 years since Deakin's ground-breaking book Waterlog: A Swimmer's Journey Through Britain, which arguably launched Britain's wild swimming movement by embracing the outdoors, encouraging the "right to swim" and arguing that "natural water has always held the magical power to cure", I wanted to journey the length of this waterway most Brits haven’t heard of with a dip, kayak and pedal about to unearth its allure. Deakin lived for 26 years in a 16th-Century farmhouse in the village of Mellis, four miles south of the Waveney, where he would swim in its moat. His regular wild dip sparked the idea of 36 swim adventures in places across Britain. Breaststroke inspired pen stroke and his cult classic emerged. In his three dozen plunges for Waterlog, he took in the Isles of Scilly with a snorkel and submersions in ice-cold tarns in Wales. But the Waveney was his favourite river and he would return to it time and again, devoting much of the chapter Extinctions to the waterway.`
